## Installation and usage
1. Go to latest [Releases page](https://github.com/digitalstars/BlueProtocol-Translate/releases) and download the required .zip archive with the translation from Assets and unpack.
2. Copy `dinput8.dll` to `C:\BandaiNamcoLauncherGames\BLUEPROTOCOL\BLUEPROTOCOL\Binaries\Win64\`.
3. Copy the `~mods` folder to `C:\BandaiNamcoLauncherGames\BLUEPROTOCOL\BLUEPROTOCOL\Content\Paks`.
4. Move the `BP-translate 1.1` folder to any location convenient for you
5. Run `BP-translate.exe` (It is necessary to restart every time you enter the game. The window will automatically close when the game starts)
6. Launch the game as usual with the BNO launcher. (It may not appear the first time.)
7. the game will start with the translation patch

* These instructions assume that you have installed the game in the standard path `C:\BandaiNamcoLauncherGames\BLUEPROTOCOL`. If you installed the game in your own path, adjust the folder paths above as necessary.

## If the server translation doesn't work:
1. So far it does not work if you use a proxy for Blue Protocol. VPN is fine
2. The .exe uses port 443, make sure it is not busy (usually with web developers)
3. May not work when antivirus software is enabled
4. Make sure you have the hosts file at the path `c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`

## Uninstall
The patch can be removed at any time by deleting the files copied in the `Installation` section:
1. Delete `dinput8.dll` from `C:\BandaiNamcoLauncherGames\BLUEPROTOCOL\BLUEPROTOCOL\Binaries\Win64\dinput8.dll`.
2. Delete the `~mods` folder from `C:\BandaiNamcoLauncherGames\BLUEPROTOCOL\BLUEPROTOCOL\Content\Paks\`.
